# 🎮 Mad Libs Word Game (Java)

Welcome to my fun and simple **Mad Libs Word Game** built in **Java**!  
This was a hands-on project to practice Java basics like variables, strings, and printing formatted output.

## 📝 Project Overview

Mad Libs is a classic word game where the player fills in the blanks to complete a story — often with hilarious or unexpected results!

In this Java project, I created a version of Mad Libs where:
- A pre-written short story contains **blank spaces**
- The player provides words (nouns, adjectives, verbs, etc.)
- The program replaces the blanks with those inputs and prints the final story

## 🔧 What I Did

- Created all the necessary **Java variables** to hold user input
- Used **string concatenation** to place those variables into the story
- Printed out a complete, dynamic Mad Libs story
